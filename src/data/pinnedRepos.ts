/**
 * Pinned / featured GitHub repositories.
 *
 * Add the exact repository names (as they appear on GitHub) that you want to
 * highlight at the top of the /projects page.  The projects grid will show
 * these first with a ⭐ "Pinned" badge, then fill the remaining slots with
 * your most-recently-updated public repos.
 *
 * Example:
 *   export const pinnedRepos: string[] = [
 *     "Voting-Escrow-Light-Client",
 *     "polkadot-light-client-demo",
 *   ];
 */
export const pinnedRepos: string[] = [
  // Add your featured repo names here
];
