## Substrate Connect

### Introduction

Blockchain interactions require communication with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to validate transactions and generate new blocks. Polkadot, like other blockchains, relies on a network of nodes that powers its consensus mechanism.

![align=center&caption=Peer-to-Peer Network&sourceTitle= Polkadot's Architecture&sourceURL=https://softtech-blog.weebly.com/outline-of-polkadot-architecture](https://d3lkc3n5th01x7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/09222628/Polkadot-node-setup.png)

To communicate between the decentralized application and a network node in Polkadot is through a JSON RPC protocol. Typically, there are 2 main ways to do this:

- **User-Controlled Nodes:** The Dapp (decentralized application) connects to a node client which the users have installed and run on their machine. These nodes are extremely secure because the users fully control it, but to install and maintain them are quietly complicated as they must be active 24/7 and connect with network rapidly.
- **Publicly-Accessible Nodes:** There are several third-parties or platforms providing a publicly-accessible node client. These nodes are available every time when users need so they are more convenient to interact. However, their drawbacks are insecure and centralized because they are controlled by their owner.

**[Substrate Connect](https://substrate.io/substrate-connect/)**, on the other hand, is introduced for decentralized application to minimally connect to Polkadot network instead of utilizing a centralized RPC node but still securely.

### Substate Connect & The perfect alternative for Substrate: Smoldot

Firstly, **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** was ever one of the core repositories in the **[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)** to help everyone to build the unique Blockchain on the Polkadot. However, it was merged with two repositories Cumulus and Polkadot into a new repository: **[the Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)**. From here, **[Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot)** is introduced as an alternative client of **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)**-based chain. 

**Smoldot** validates the submitted transactions (from users) before sending to full nodes (centralized nodes) by itself to add those transactions to the transaction pool. **Substrate Connect** provides the infrastructure necessary to run **light clients** directly in the browsers. By default, **Substrate Connect** runs in the browser independently with each browser tab, install the browser extension to enable resource sharing among browser tabs. With **Substrate Connect**, there’s no need for a centralized RPC node; it operates like a bridge, running **[Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot)** in the browser extension making it possible for every tabs or website to sync with the chain.

Abstractly, **Smoldot** is used to interact with the **relay chain** or a **parachain**, it always needs to sync with the relay chain. What about for a parachain? The parachain's finalized state is guaranteed on the relay chain. To verify whether a relay chain block is finalized, the light client needs to know the **elected validators** from the **GRANDPA** protocol <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. **[GRANDPA](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf) (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement)** is the finality gadget that is implemented for the relay chain <span className="font-bold reference">[9]</span>. The **Polkadot Host** uses the **GRANDPA** finality protocol to finality blocks. The condition for Smoldot to set the block finalized is that more than **2/3** of the validators nodes voted **FOR** on the block and the signatures are correct. Polkadot uses **NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake)** as its mechanism for selecting the validator set. Changes authority set or validator set are crucial to track for a node who tries to sync with the relay chain in order to verify justifications. The speed up way to sync which its proposed is **[warp sync](https://spec.polkadot.network/chap-networking#sect-msg-warp-sync)**. Instead of downloading the entire chain as the **[full sync protocol](https://spec.polkadot.network/chap-sync#id-full-sync)** or downloading the block header history and validating the authority set changes like **[fast sync](https://spec.polkadot.network/chap-sync#sect-sync-fast)** , it only downloads the block headers where authority set changes occurred and this things are called **fragments**. These fragments form the arrays and concat with the boolean value indicating whether the warp sync has been completed as the below format:

<div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-2">
    <div className="flex flex-row items-end">
    <span className="text-4xl self-center">$$ P = (f_{x}...f_{y},c)$$</span>
    <span className="font-bold reference">[9]</span>
  </div>
  <div className="w-auto flex flex-col justify-center">
    <span>**$$f_{x}...f_{y}$$**:  is an array consisting of warp sync fragments.</span>
    <span>**$$c$$**:  is the boolean indicates whether the warp sync has been completed.</span>
  </div>
</div>

When it is up to date with the latest **GRANDPA**, Smoldot will start syncing with the chain similar to a full node. Smoldot only retrieve new block headers and verify by verifying the **authenticity** of those blocks <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. In addition, Polkadot also uses the **BABE protocol** to produce the new blocks. **BABE (Blind Assignmnent for Blockchain Extension)** is the block production mechanism that runs between the validator nodes and determines the author or the owner of new blocks. After Smoldot verifies th block header, whether the author of the block was selected by **BABE** protocol. Practically, BABE separate into many epochs, with each epochs being divided into **slots**. All slots in each epoch are sequentially indexed starting from 0. At the beginning of each epoch, the BABE needs to run the **[Block Production Lottery](https://spec.polkadot.network/sect-block-production#algo-block-production-lottery)** to find out which slots it should produce a block and gossip to the other block producers.

Finally, Smoldot verifies the **consensus** and the finality by tracking consecutively the authority set. The authority set will be obtained through the runtime when it updates the chain  it acquires subsequent changes from the block headers. <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span> 

### What does Smoldot need to run ?

In order to start syncing with a chain, the Smoldot requires the list of information called **[chainspec](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/chain_spec.rs#L18-L34)**. A chain specification is the description of everything related the chain being desired connected and required for the client to successfully interact with that chain. The chainspec only consists of **[clientspec](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/main/src/chain_spec/structs.rs#L33)** that look like as the following structure:

```rs showLineNumbers
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
pub(super) struct ClientSpec {
    pub(super) name: String,
    pub(super) id: String,

    #[serde(default)]
    pub(super) chain_type: ChainType,

    #[serde(default)]
    pub(super) code_substitutes: HashMap<u64, HexString, fnv::FnvBuildHasher>,
    pub(super) boot_nodes: Vec<String>,
    pub(super) telemetry_endpoints: Option<Vec<(String, u8)>>,
    pub(super) protocol_id: Option<String>,
    
    #[serde(default = "Default::default", skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub(super) fork_id: Option<String>,
    
    #[serde(default = "Default::default", skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub(super) block_number_bytes: Option<u8>,
    pub(super) properties: Option<Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>>,
    pub(super) fork_blocks: Option<Vec<(u64, HashHexString)>>,
    pub(super) bad_blocks: Option<HashSet<HashHexString, FnvBuildHasher>>,
    
    #[serde(default, skip_serializing)]
    #[allow(unused)]
    pub(super) consensus_engine: (),
    pub(super) genesis: Genesis,
    pub(super) light_sync_state: Option<LightSyncState>,
    
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub(super) parachain: Option<ChainSpecParachain>,
}

```

From the chainspec, the **[chain information](https://github.com/Daanvdplas/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/chain/chain_information.rs#L118-L129)** is built. As we can see in the code, the chain information is all the crucial information Smoldot requires to verify the consensus and finality <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. It will be constructed from either:

  - The genesis state
  - The **[checkpoint](https://github.com/Daanvdplas/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/chain_spec/light_sync_state.rs#L65)**
  - From the database

As a result, the chain information provides the starting authority set for the warp sync process <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>.

```rs showLineNumbers {4, 7, 10} highlight{red}
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ChainInformation {
    /// Header of the highest known finalized block.
    pub finalized_block_header: header::Header,

    /// Extra items that depend on the consensus engine.
    pub consensus: ChainInformationConsensus,

    /// Extra items that depend on the finality engine.
    pub finality: ChainInformationFinality,
}
```
However, to sync with a chain it needs much more information like that. It requires the information from other peers and therefore needs to join the peer-to-peer network.

### Networking

![size=medium&caption=Networking Service&alt=Networking Service&sourceTitle=Smoldot: Hello world!&sourceURL=https://hackmd.io/@s_iGZLIITG6WjSgnFX0pcg/rkmmcvBno](https://i.imgur.com/5LcReWd.png) 

First of all, in order to connect to other nodes Smoldot needs the **[networking service](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/network_service.rs#L18-L37)**. It's responsible to try stay connected as much as possible to the nodes of the peer-to-peer network of the chain and maintain open substreams with them in order to send out requests and notifications <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. The network service will create on background task for each active connection. There are 3 background tasks, the network service needs to start:

  - Process the network service (main task). **[Source code](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/network_service.rs#L282)** 
```rs showLineNumbers
(config.tasks_executor)(
  "network-service".into(),
  Box::pin({
      let shared = shared.clone();
      let future = background_task(shared, event_senders);

      let (abortable, abort_handle) = future::abortable(future);
      abort_handles.push(abort_handle);
      abortable.map(|_| ())
  }),
);
```
  - Network discovery (done through a separate task). **[Source code](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/network_service.rs#L296)**
```rs showLineNumbers
(config.tasks_executor)(
  "network-discovery".into(),
  Box::pin({
      let shared = shared.clone();
      let future = async move {
          let mut next_discovery = Duration::from_secs(5);

          loop {
              TPlat::sleep(next_discovery).await;
              next_discovery = cmp::min(next_discovery * 2, Duration::from_secs(120));

              let mut guarded = shared.guarded.lock().await;
              for chain_index in 0..shared.log_chain_names.len() {
                  let operation_id = guarded
                      .network
                      .start_kademlia_discovery_round(TPlat::now(), chain_index);

                  let _prev_value = guarded
                      .kademlia_discovery_operations
                      .insert(operation_id, chain_index);
                  debug_assert!(_prev_value.is_none());
              }
              shared.wake_up_main_background_task.notify(1);
          }
      };

      let (abortable, abort_handle) = future::abortable(future);
      abort_handles.push(abort_handle);
      abortable.map(|_| ())
  }),
);
```
  - Process existing connections. **[Source code](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/network_service.rs#L332)**
  ```rs showLineNumbers
  (config.tasks_executor)(
    "connections".into(),
    Box::pin({
        let future = async move {
            let mut connections = stream::FuturesUnordered::new();
            loop {
                futures::select! {
                    new_connec = new_tasks_rx.select_next_some() => {
                        connections.push(new_connec);
                    },
                    () = connections.select_next_some() => {},
                }
            }
        };

        let (abortable, abort_handle) = future::abortable(future);
        abort_handles.push(abort_handle);
        abortable.map(|_| ())
    }),
  );
  ```
#### Processing the networking service <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

This task is the main task in execution task of Smoldot. It ensures the objective of the Networking Service as we mentioned that Smoldot is always connected to the peer-to-peer network. The amount of `in-slots` and `out-slots` refer, to the maximum amount of peers that can connect to Smoldot and the maximum amount of peers Smoldot connect to <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. In the **[full node](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/main/bin/full-node/src/run/network_service.rs#L222)**, the number of 
**in_slots** and **out_slots** is 25 for each. However, the **[light node](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/main/bin/light-base/src/network_service.rs#L218)** only has 3 for **in_slots** and the **out_slots** is 4. Smoldot uses the **[libp2p protocol](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/libp2p/collection.rs#L18-L48)** to coordinates the requests and responses from the connections to Smoldot and vice versa.

- Assign **out_slots**: <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

Only the maximum number of slots is not reached and that peers have not had a slot yet, the combinations of notifications protocol and peers will be marked as **"desired"**. In addition, it inserts that peer to **out_peers** in **[ChainConfig](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/main/src/network/service.rs#L110)**. (The **[assign_out_slot](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/main/src/network/service.rs#L1088)** occurs in **[update_round process](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/network_service.rs#L1327)**)

```rs showLineNumbers
  pub fn assign_out_slot(&mut self, chain_index: usize, peer_id: PeerId) {
        let chain = &mut self.chains[chain_index];

        // Check if maximum number of slots is reached.
        if chain.out_peers.len()
            >= usize::try_from(chain.chain_config.out_slots).unwrap_or(usize::max_value())
        {
            return; 
        }

        // Don't assign slots to peers that already have a slot.
        if chain.out_peers.contains(&peer_id) || chain.in_peers.contains(&peer_id) {
            return; 
        }

        self.inner.set_peer_notifications_out_desired(
            &peer_id,
            chain_index * NOTIFICATIONS_PROTOCOLS_PER_CHAIN,
            peers::DesiredState::DesiredReset, 
        );

        chain.out_peers.insert(peer_id);
    }
```

- Start new connections with desired peers: <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

After all peer assignments, the list of connections should be opened. 

```rs showLineNumbers
    loop {
        let start_connect = match guarded.network.next_start_connect(|| TPlat::now()) {
            Some(sc) => sc,
            None => break,
        };

        let is_important = guarded
            .important_nodes
            .contains(&start_connect.expected_peer_id);

        // Perform the connection process in a separate task.
        let task = tasks::connection_task(
            start_connect,
            shared.clone(),
            guarded.messages_from_connections_tx.clone(),
            is_important,
        );

        // Sending the new task might fail in case a shutdown is happening, in which case
        // we don't really care about the state of anything anymore.
        // The sending here is normally very quick.
        let _ = guarded.new_tasks_tx.send(Box::pin(task)).await;
    }
```

**[During starting connections](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/main/src/network/service.rs#L997)**, the API user muse give that they use **single stream** or **multi stream** to report how connection attempt went. 

```rs showLineNumbers
    pub fn next_start_connect(&mut self, now: impl FnOnce() -> TNow) -> Option<StartConnect<TNow>> {
        // Ask the underlying state machine which nodes are desired but don't have any
        // associated connection attempt yet.
        // Since the underlying state machine is only made aware of connections when
        // `pending_outcome_ok` is reached, we must filter out nodes that already have an
        // associated `PendingId`.
        let unfulfilled_desired_peers = self.inner.unfulfilled_desired_peers();

        for peer_id in unfulfilled_desired_peers {
            // TODO: allow more than one simultaneous dial per peer, and distribute the dials so that we don't just return the same peer multiple times in a row while there are other peers waiting
            let entry = match self.num_pending_per_peer.entry(peer_id.clone()) {
                hashbrown::hash_map::Entry::Occupied(_) => continue,
                hashbrown::hash_map::Entry::Vacant(entry) => entry,
            };

            let multiaddr: multiaddr::Multiaddr = {
                let potential = self
                    .chains
                    .iter_mut()
                    .flat_map(|chain| chain.kbuckets.iter_mut_ordered())
                    .find(|(p, _)| **p == *entry.key())
                    .and_then(|(peer_id, _)| {
                        self.kbuckets_peers
                            .get_mut(peer_id)
                            .unwrap()
                            .addresses
                            .addr_to_pending()
                    });
                match potential {
                    Some(a) => a.clone(),
                    None => continue,
                }
            };

            let now = now();
            let pending_id = PendingId(self.pending_ids.insert((
                entry.key().clone(),
                multiaddr.clone(),
                now.clone(),
            )));

            let start_connect = StartConnect {
                expected_peer_id: entry.key().clone(),
                id: pending_id,
                multiaddr,
                timeout: now + self.handshake_timeout,
            };

            entry.insert(NonZeroUsize::new(1).unwrap());

            return Some(start_connect);
        }

        None
    }
```

After creating connections, Smoldot perform the connection process in a separate task

```rs showLineNumbers
  let task = tasks::connection_task(
      start_connect,
      shared.clone(),
      guarded.messages_from_connections_tx.clone(),
      is_important,
  );
  let _ = guarded.new_tasks_tx.send(Box::pin(task)).await;
```

- The coordinator is updated about the connectivity status with a give peer. It's responsible for distributing it to the right service.  <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>
 
- Process requests and updates from other services:  <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

Smoldot pulls the messages that the coordinator has generated in destination to the various connections and sends that messages to the active connections.

```rs showLineNumbers
    loop {
        let (connection_id, message) = match guarded.network.pull_message_to_connection() {
            Some(m) => m,
            None => break,
        };

        // Note that it is critical for the sending to not take too long here, in order to not
        // block the process of the network service.
        // In particular, if sending the message to the connection is blocked due to sending
        // a message on the connection-to-coordinator channel, this will result in a deadlock.
        // For this reason, the connection task is always ready to immediately accept a message
        // on the coordinator-to-connection channel.
        guarded
            .active_connections
            .get_mut(&connection_id)
            .unwrap()
            .send(message)
            .await
            .unwrap();
    }
```

#### Network discovery

In a peer-to-peer network, it's necessary to have the information of the connection to connect to any given peer, available at any given time. To make this information decentralized, Smoldot need to divide it over all the peers through the **[Kademlia Distributed Hash Tables](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dht/#distributed-hash-tables-dhts)** <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. It's a distributed system for mapping keys to values in IPFS. Each information or data in IPFS would be hashed to get its digest and with each data changes the hash digest would be changed as well.

In the **Distributed hash table**, each node was called **[k-buckets](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/network/kademlia/kbuckets.rs#L18-L67)**, which make a partial view of the complete list of all the peers in the network. <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

```rs showLineNumbers
    pub struct KBuckets<K, V, TNow, const ENTRIES_PER_BUCKET: usize> {
        /// Key of the "local" node, that holds the buckets.
        local_key: (K, Key),
        /// List of buckets, ordered by increasing distance. In other words, the first elements of
        /// this field are the ones that are the closest to [`KBuckets::local_key`].
        buckets: Vec<Bucket<K, V, TNow, ENTRIES_PER_BUCKET>>,
        /// Duration after which the last entry of each bucket will expired if it is disconnected.
        pending_timeout: Duration,
    }
```

The objective of Network discovery is that sending a **Kademlia** "find node" request to single peer. Moreover, 
Smoldot based on the **[Kademlia request-response protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/kad-dht#rpc-messages)** to build a wire message to get the nodes closest to the parameters <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>. The following steps is to decide which peer it sends the request message:

- Creating a Sha256 hash digest from the a random created peerID (`local_key`), the target hash. <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

```rs showLineNumbers
    pub fn new(local_key: K, pending_timeout: Duration) -> Self {
        let local_key_hashed = Key::new(local_key.as_ref());

        KBuckets {
            local_key: (local_key, local_key_hashed),
            buckets: (0..256)
                .map(|_| Bucket {
                    entries: arrayvec::ArrayVec::new(),
                    num_connected_entries: 0,
                    pending_entry: None,
                })
                .collect(),
            pending_timeout,
        }
    }
```
- Finding out the k-buckets for the closest peers <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

```rs showLineNumbers
    pub fn get(&self, key: &K) -> Option<&V> {
        let key_hashed = Key::new(key.as_ref());
        let distance = match distance_log2(&self.local_key.1, &key_hashed) {
            Some(d) => d,
            None => return None,
        };

        self.buckets[usize::from(distance)].get(key)
    }

    pub fn get_mut(&mut self, key: &K) -> Option<&mut V> {
        let key_hashed = Key::new(key.as_ref());
        let distance = match distance_log2(&self.local_key.1, &key_hashed) {
            Some(d) => d,
            None => return None,
        };

        self.buckets[usize::from(distance)].get_mut(key)
    }
```

- Hashing the peerIDs of closest peers and sorting its list with ascending order of the log2 distance between the target hash and the k-bucket peer's hash. <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

```rs showLineNumbers
    pub fn closest_entries(&self, target: &K) -> impl Iterator<Item = (&K, &V)> {
        // TODO: this is extremely unoptimized
        let target_hashed = Key::new(target.as_ref());
        let mut list = self.iter_ordered().collect::<Vec<_>>();
        list.sort_by_key(|(key, _)| {
            let key_hashed = Key::new(key.as_ref());
            distance_log2(&key_hashed, &target_hashed).map_or(0, |d| u16::from(d) + 1)
        });
        list.into_iter()
    }
```

- It obtains the peer with the shortest distance and where it already has an established connection. <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>
 
#### Processing existing connections <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

Smoldot has 2 types of connections such as **[TCP](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/webtransport/)** connection and **[WebRTC](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/webrtc/)** connection.

- TCP is the Single Stream connection where the browser just sends or receives data and Smoldot implements substreams on top of that.

- In the **Multi stream** WebRTC connection the browser deals with the substreams.

There are two types of substreams: <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

1. Notifications: 
    1. Block announcements protocol
    2. GRANDPA announcements protocol (GRANDPA commits)
    3. Transaction announcements protocol (not implemented for Smoldot)
2. Request-response: 
    1. IPFS id protocol
    2. Sync protocol
    3. Light protocol
    4. Kademlia protocol
    5. Sync warp protocol
    6. State protocol

### Synchronization service <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

After, The networking service has been set up it starts a new background task, the **[synchronization service](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/sync.rs#L18-L69)**. The objective of the sync service is to do whatever necessary to get and stay up to date with the best and finalized blocks of the chain.

Generally, Smoldot will track a list of **[sources](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/sync/all_forks/sources.rs#L18-L26)**, which represent peers that Smoldot receives new block headers and GRANDPA commits from. With the received information from a given peer, it will know which blocks this peer is aware of.

### Runtime service <span className="font-bold reference">[7]</span>

After synchronization service, the next task is the **[runtime service](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/runtime_service.rs#L18-L55)**. Typically, this service wants to have the latest finalized downloaded runtime to provide to other services. Therefore, it needs to stay up to date with the chain.

### Transaction service

Everything which relate to transactions will be handled by **[transaction service](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/transactions.rs#L18-L86)**. As we know, when the transaction sent from the user to network would be injected to the pool called as **[transaction pool](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/transactions/pool.rs#L18-L79)**. This transactions will hold the pending status and wait until mining or validating by active nodes to add to the new blocks. What's about in Light Client? The **[transaction service](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/bin/light-base/src/transactions_service.rs#L18-L68)** and **[transaction pool](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/transactions/light_pool.rs#L18-L60)** are most of the time idle. Because of this, it is only operating when the user submits a transaction.

### JSON-RPC service

Finally, as the last asynchronous task, the **[JSON-RPC service](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/json_rpc.rs#L18-L60)** will be spawned. It holds a **[state machine](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/json_rpc/requests_subscriptions.rs#L18-L106)** which consists of a list of client, list of request sent by a client but not yet pulled by, and the **[request subscriptions](https://github.com/paritytech/smoldot/blob/76994b52cd658a4ac1dc7a08f6bd4eba702e0e87/src/json_rpc/requests_subscriptions.rs#L89-L106)**

### Why use Substrate Connect ?

**Polkadot** is designed with decentralization at its core, following the **Blockchain Trilemma** **(Decentralization**, **Security**, and **Scalability)**. However, most user interfaces connect to the network through centralized nodes, making decentralization challenging. **[Substrate Connect](https://substrate.io/substrate-connect/)** provides a lightweight, decentralized option for DApps to interact securely with Polkadot, lowering complexity for end-users.


## Integrating the Light Client by Smoldot in your User Interface !!!

This guide walks you through integrating a Light Client with **[Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot) , [Substrate Connect](https://substrate.io/substrate-connect/) **and **[Dedot](https://docs.dedot.dev/)** (an alternative to **[PolkadotJS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/)** ) in our demo application.

Our repository is using **Next.Js** framework to build the **User-Interface** **Application** for Decentralized Application - **[Demo](https://github.com/0xharryriddle/Voting-Escrow-Light-Client)**

### Prepare the Chain Specification JSON

Firstly, we must prepare the chain specification json file for the Relaychain or Parachain. We can find the chain specification of our expected network in Substrate Connect repository.

```bash showLineNumbers
    https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-connect/tree/main/packages/connect-known-chains/specs
```

### Install Dependencies

Install necessary packages such as **smoldot** , **@dedot/chaintypes** and a compatible version of **Dedot**:
    
```bash showLineNumbers
    npm install smoldot dedot@0.5.0 @dedot/chaintypes
```

### Implement Substrate Connect Provider and Client

Set up the **Substrate Connect Provider** and **Client** in a custom hook for use in your **Next.js** or **React** project: 

```bash showLineNumbers
    https://github.com/0xharryriddle/Voting-Escrow-Light-Client/blob/main/src/hooks/useApi.ts
```

![align=center](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad2d53e7-f2c3-4ae1-9c41-c96d987e8bba_1514x2390.png)

### Configure API Context for Project Layout

Integrate the Light Client provider across your application with an API Context setup:

```bash showLineNumbers
    https://github.com/0xharryriddle/Voting-Escrow-Light-Client/blob/main/src/providers/ApiProvider.tsx
```

![align=center](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f375d61-ff45-4a1d-9d80-b35dbf605ef2_1514x2876.png)

```bash showLineNumbers
    https://github.com/0xharryriddle/Voting-Escrow-Light-Client/tree/main/src/app
```
![align=center](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42e11e8b-4212-4d0f-80b5-7d9b7baf210e_1514x1460.png)

### Test the Light Client Connection

Run our application with:

```bash showLineNumbers
    npm run dev
```

If successful, you’ll see confirmation in the browser console 🎉. This confirms your Light Client is now operational within your Dapp!

![align=center](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3718a3-c5bb-44ce-9419-5d101b2497d7_1910x314.png)

In this context, we used the **Edge Browser** to access to our application.

#### Interact with Smart Contracts

Using the “api” client from the API Context, interact with the Relaychain or Parachain via **[Dedot SDK](https://docs.dedot.dev/)** or **[PolkadotJS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/)** to call smart contracts.

## Challenges 💪🏻

The **Smoldot SDK** supports **WASM-compatible** browsers, so ensure your Dapp runs on a browser optimized for WASM.
