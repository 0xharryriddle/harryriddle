## Introduction

Light clients allow decentralized applications to verify blockchain state directly without trusting centralized RPC providers. This tutorial walks you through integrating **Substrate Connect** — Polkadot's in-browser light client — into a React application.

## Why Light Clients?

Traditional dApps rely on centralized RPC endpoints (e.g., Infura, Alchemy). This creates:

- **Single points of failure** — if the provider goes down, your app breaks
- **Trust assumptions** — you must trust the provider is returning honest data
- **Censorship risks** — providers can block requests

Light clients solve all of these problems by running a minimal node directly in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- React/Next.js project setup
- TypeScript knowledge
- Understanding of Polkadot architecture

## Coming Soon

This tutorial is currently being written. Check back for the complete guide covering:

- Setting up Substrate Connect in a React app
- Connecting to Polkadot and parachains
- Querying state through the light client
- Handling chain synchronization UX
- Performance optimization strategies
